================================================

Text-based adventure game I wrote for CSCI 1100.
The game is designed to help children around 
grades four and five bolster their basic math 
skills. Although repetition is important for 
improving math skills, I've reduced the number 
of enemy encounters. (Battles are fought with math,
so if you've downloaded the game and and want to 
play, the game won't be too long.)


I wrote the game before I knew anything about 
object-oriented programming; in fact, I taught 
myself object-oriented programming so I could 
write this game. As such, the code is not my 
best work. That said, it runs, and the game is 
cute. I do intend to rewrite the game now that 
I know what I'm doing.
