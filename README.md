================================================

Text-based adventure game I wrote for CSCI 1100.
The game is designed to help children around 
grades four and five bolster their basic math 
skills. Although repetition is important for 
improving math skills, I've reduced the number 
of enemy encounters (battles are fought with math,
so if you've downloaded the game and and want to 
play, the game won't be too long.


I wrote the game before I knew anything about 
object-oriented programming. As such, the code 
is a really big mess. That said, it runs, and 
the game is cute. I do intend to rewrite the 
game now that I know what I'm doing! Until then,
thoughts and prayers to anyone who dares try to 
read my code.
