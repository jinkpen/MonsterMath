================================================

Text-based adventure game I wrote for CSCI 1100.
The game is designed to help children around 
grades four and five bolster their basic math 
skills.

Go on an adventure, fighting monsters with math.

Use the skills you practised on the way to defeat
the final boss.

Notes about the code:

Though repetition is important for improving math
skills, the number of enemy encounters is reduces
so the game is shorter for demonstration purposes.

I wrote the game before I knew anything about 
object-oriented programming; in fact, I taught 
myself object-oriented programming so I could 
write this game. As such, the code is not my 
best work. That said, it runs, and the game is 
cute. I do intend to rewrite the game now that 
I know what I'm doing.
